A Study of Factors Affecting Crime Rates in the United States During the 2010s
This study explores the relationship between various explanatory variables and crime rates in the United States during the decade from 2010 to 2019. The primary aim is to determine how factors such as personal income per capita, unemployment rate, marijuana legalization, population density, and educational attainment correlate with the crime rates across different states.

Dataset Description
The dataset comprises annual data from 2010 to 2019 for all 50 states, encompassing 500 observations. The primary variables include:

Crime Rate: Number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants.
Personal Income Per Capita: Income in dollars divided by the population.
Unemployment Rate: The percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force.
Marijuana Legalization: Year of marijuana legalization, treated as a dummy variable.
Population Density: Number of people per square mile.
Educational Attainment: Percentage of individuals with a high school degree or higher.
Data sources include the FBI's Crime Data Explorer, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and other authoritative sources.

Research Methodology
The study employs a multiple linear regression model to assess the impact of the independent variables on the crime rate. It includes statistical tests such as the White test and RESET test for model validation.

Key Findings
The study found no significant relationship between marijuana legalization and crime rates, contradicting initial hypotheses.
Personal income per capita and educational attainment show negative correlations with crime rates, while unemployment rate impacts are less clear and depend on the model specification.
Population density's relationship with crime was opposite to expected; higher density correlated with lower crime rates.
Model Specifications
The final models and regression outputs are detailed in the associated research paper. Adjustments were made for potential heteroskedasticity, and interaction terms were introduced to capture more complex relationships.

Limitations and Further Research
The research acknowledges limitations due to data availability and potential omitted variable biases. Further studies could explore additional variables and refine the models based on new data.
